/*isNaN(<something>);check if something is number or not. Returns false on number, otherwise, true.Be careful: if you call isNaN on a string that looks like a number, like '42', JavaScript will try to help by automatically converting the string '42' to the number 42 and return false (since 42 is a number).Used in if statement as a boolean, it is possible to do error proofing for not-numbers.----------*/var lunch = prompt("What do you want for lunch?", "Type your lumch choice here");switch(lunch){    case 'sandwich':        console.log("Sure thing!
